TODOs:
[ ] strengthen `split_goals.v` to test more complex goal flow.
    running a tactic on all (multiple) goals in focus.
    multi-level nested goals.
[ ] update CI to use `just`.
    installing `just` is a bit annoying. maybe use brew. maybe raw install.
[ ] update readme to explicitly mention goal diff'ing feature.
    this is an important optimization for LLM context management,
    and there's probably lots of room for improvement.
